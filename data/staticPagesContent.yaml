    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative Hub: The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Hub is an entry point for researchers, data scientists, and citizen scientists looking to use and connect with CCDI-related data. It provides information about available tools and applications that support the CCDI vision, along with descriptions of resources, each of which targets specific aspects of childhood cancer research. The Hub also provides direct links to resources and additional technical information. Users are invited to explore the Hub or select a resource’s link to learn more."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative: The NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. By connecting, analyzing, and easily sharing data among researchers, we can increase our understanding of childhood cancers and improve treatment, quality of life, and survivorship for all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer."

    - paragraph: "Molecular Characterization and Clinical Data from Multiple Organizations Released. Pediatric brain tumor data from several organizations are available pre-publication and without embargo. CCDI has facilitated the release of data from children and young adults diagnosed with pediatric brain tumors and other solid and hematologic malignancies. The data was collected from the Children’s Brain Tumor Network, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Division for Genomic Diagnostics. They include tumor and germline WGS, RNA-Seq, Clinical Panel Sequencing, and other omics and molecular data."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Catalog update includes new resource. The Cancer Dependency Map provides open access to tools that can aid drug target and biomarker discovery. The CCDI Childhood Cancer Data Catalog (CCDC) now includes the Cancer Dependency Map, which provides open access to analytical and visualization tools related to key cancer dependencies. These tools can be used in the discovery of drug targets and biomarkers. In addition to this, six existing CCDC resources have been updated."
    - paragraph: "Molecular Targets Platform releases data updates and enhanced features. The latest update to the Molecular Targets Platform includes new data and enhanced features. Learn about the recent release. The Molecular Targets Platform (MTP) expanded with new data and enhanced features. Researchers will find new and updated data from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas and TARGET cohorts, including sequencing and methylation data. Improved features include enhanced gene expression graphs for childhood cancer data and a new widget to capture methylation data. Finally, the latest coding updates ensure that the data can be easily viewed and queried."
