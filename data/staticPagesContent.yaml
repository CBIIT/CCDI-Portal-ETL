    - paragraph: "Automated Extraction and Provision of Electronic Health Record Data from Children with Cancer to National Childhood Cancer Center (NCCR) cancer registries, September 2024, AACR 2024 Special Conference in Cancer Research: Advances in Pediatric Cancer Research, The National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is a central infrastructure that integrates childhood cancer data from central cancer registries and other sources to enhance access to and utilization of pediatric cancer data. The NCCR currently represents >70% of the United States pediatric population. Registries collect and publish cancer incidence and survival data for public health surveillance. Electronic health records (EHRs) are one data source. EHR data are currently obtained by manual collection at individual hospitals that then transfer data to population-based cancer registries. This study aimed to use automated data collection from hospital EHRs to broaden and standardize data reported to registries."
    - paragraph: "Harmonization of Real-World Data to Common Data Elements for the National Childhood Cancer Registry, May 2024, AMIA 2024 Clinical Informatics Conference, While cancer in children and adolescents is rare, it is the primary cause of death from disease for those over the age of 1. The ability to conduct high quality population-level research studies that leverages all available data is crucial in rare disease such as childhood cancer. However, data captured by research consortiums, NCI-supported Cancer Centers, hospitals, and other sources are typically stranded in institutional data silos and unavailable for secondary data analyses within and across institutions. These RWD are frequently encoded using source-specific data models that are not harmonized or interoperable with data from other sources. Most treating institutions report case information to central cancer registries in the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) standard as part of legally-mandated cancer surveillance. However, cancer registries typically do not receive detailed diagnostic, treatment, or long-term follow-up information that are valuable for understanding a patient’s long-term health outcomes during and after a cancer diagnosis. Augmenting existing cancer registry data with harmonized data from other sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), genomic data, and institutional datasets, would greatly enhance the value of cancer registries for surveillance and research."
    - paragraph: "Building a national molecular profiling strategy: A report from the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative and the Childrens Oncology Group Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee, November 2023, Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) 2023 Annual meeting, The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), is a 10-year, $50 million per year, US federal investment to advance pediatric cancer research through both new data generation and development of platforms for sharing data. The goal of the initiative is to learn from every child, adolescent, and young adult by bringing together the research, advocacy, and care communities in an ambitious effort to build a Data Ecosystem that enables rapid and systematic data collection, sharing, access, and analysis. A key component of the CCDI is the NCI’s Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI). The MCI was initiated in 2022 and is run in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG). The MCI offers at no cost to patients and institutions, clinically annotated, genomic characterization of tumors and germline samples to patients and their physician. These data are then deposited in an NCI repository for secondary use by the community. Here, we detail the MCI soft tissue sarcoma (STS) workflow and describe the first year of enrollment experience."
    - paragraph: "The Molecular Characterization Initiative: A clinical, pathologic and genomic resource for the international pediatric brain tumor community, June 2024, 2024 AANP National Conference, The Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI) launched in 2022 under the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) in partnership with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG). MCI represents a national strategy facilitating appropriate clinical and molecular characterization of childhood cancers while building an accessible data ecosystem. Since activation, 2400+ pediatric patients with CNS tumors have enrolled from 184 COG sites across the U.S. and globally. MCI provides free comprehensive genomic profiling for newly diagnosed CNS tumors, with results returned to physicians within 21 days. De-identified clinical and genomic data are deposited in the CCDI repository and may be accessed via the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes through a controlled data access request. Digital whole slide images corresponding to the extracted tissues are accessed through NCI Imaging Data Commons."
    - paragraph: "NCI’s National Childhood Cancer Registry Data Platform: A New Data Sharing Resource to Analyze Cancer Surveillance and Real World Data, November 2024, AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium, Childhood cancers are rare diseases with approximately 16,000 cases diagnosed annually in the US.¹ Childhood cancer research data are typically captured through multicenter clinical trials and available only to consortium members, or investigator-initiated research at a single institution. Cancer treatment is also delivered outside of clinical trials—real-world data generated as a by-product of clinical care are typically siloed in distinct institutional information systems (Electronic Health Records, Radiation Oncology, Laboratory, and Imaging) and are not available for general research use. While central cancer registries collect information on all reported cancers in their jurisdiction, their data have not been linked across registries and with real world data at the national level before. Finally, as patients and their families travel across the US for treatment, a single registry or institution may not hold all data representing a patient’s cancer journey. Data from all these sources typically reside at different institutions with different governance frameworks and have been encoded in a variety of standard and non-standard formats, making them unavailable for research use."
    - paragraph: "Childhood cancer data initiative: Status report, October 2023, In March 2023, over 800 researchers, clinicians, patients, survivors, and advocates from the pediatric oncology community met to discuss the progress of the National Cancer Institute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. We present here the status of the initiative's efforts in building its data ecosystem and updates on key programs, especially the Molecular Characterization Initiative and the planned Coordinated National Initiative for Rare Cancers in Children and Young Adults. These activities aim to improve access to childhood cancer data, foster collaborations, facilitate integrative data analysis, and expand access to molecular characterization, ultimately leading to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches."
    - paragraph: "The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative: Using the Power of Data to Learn From and Improve Outcomes for Every Child and Young Adult With Pediatric Cancer, June 2023, Data-driven basic, translational, and clinical research has resulted in improved outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with pediatric cancers. However, challenges in sharing data between institutions, particularly in research, prevent addressing substantial unmet needs in children and AYA patients diagnosed with certain pediatric cancers. Systematically collecting and sharing data from every child and AYA can enable greater understanding of pediatric cancers, improve survivorship, and accelerate development of new and more effective therapies. To accomplish this goal, the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) was launched in 2019 at the National Cancer Institute. CCDI is a collaborative community endeavor supported by a 10-year, $50-million (in US dollars) annual federal investment. CCDI aims to learn from every patient diagnosed with a pediatric cancer by designing and building a data ecosystem that facilitates data collection, sharing, and analysis for researchers, clinicians, and patients across the cancer community. For example, CCDI's Molecular Characterization Initiative provides comprehensive clinical molecular characterization for children and AYAs with newly diagnosed cancers. Through these efforts, the CCDI strives to provide clinical benefit to patients and improvements in diagnosis and care through data-focused research support and to build expandable, sustainable data resources and workflows to advance research well past the planned 10 years of the initiative. Importantly, if CCDI demonstrates the success of this model for pediatric cancers, similar approaches can be applied to adults, transforming both clinical research and treatment to improve outcomes for all patients with cancer."
    - paragraph: "OpenPBTA: The Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas, May 2023, Pediatric brain and spinal cancers are collectively the leading disease-related cause of death in children; thus, we urgently need curative therapeutic strategies for these tumors. To accelerate such discoveries, the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) created a systematic process for tumor biobanking, model generation, and sequencing with immediate access to harmonized data. We leverage these data to establish OpenPBTA, an open collaborative project with over 40 scalable analysis modules that genomically characterize 1,074 pediatric brain tumors. Transcriptomic classification reveals universal TP53 dysregulation in mismatch repair-deficient hypermutant high-grade gliomas and TP53 loss as a significant marker for poor overall survival in ependymomas and H3 K28-mutant diffuse midline gliomas. Already being actively applied to other pediatric cancers and PNOC molecular tumor board decision-making, OpenPBTA is an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community."
    - paragraph: "The Pediatric Proton and Photon Therapy Comparison Cohort: Study Design for a Multicenter Retrospective Cohort to Investigate Subsequent Cancers After Pediatric Radiation Therapy, May 2023, The physical properties of protons lower doses to surrounding normal tissues compared with photons, potentially reducing acute and long-term adverse effects, including subsequent cancers. The magnitude of benefit is uncertain, however, and currently based largely on modeling studies. Despite the paucity of directly comparative data, the number of proton centers and patients are expanding exponentially. Direct studies of the potential risks and benefits are needed in children, who have the highest risk of radiation-related subsequent cancers. The Pediatric Proton and Photon Therapy Comparison Cohort aims to meet this need."
    - paragraph: "Protocol for using single-cell sequencing to study the heterogeneity of NF1 nerve sheath tumors from clinical biospecimens, June 2023, Single-cell sequencing is a powerful technology to understand the heterogeneity of clinical biospecimens. Here, we present a protocol for obtaining single-cell suspension from neurofibromatosis type 1-associated nerve sheath tumors for transcriptomic profiling on the 10x platform. We describe steps for clinical sample collection, generation of single-cell suspension, and cell capture and sequencing. We then detail methods for integrative analysis, developmental Schwann cell trajectory building using bioinformatic tools, and comparative analysis. This protocol can be adapted for single-cell sequencing using mouse nerve tumors. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Zhang et al. (2022).1."
    - paragraph: "Large scale genotype‐ and phenotype‐driven machine learning in Von Hippel‐Lindau disease, April 2022, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome where individuals are predisposed to tumor development in the brain, adrenal gland, kidney, and other organs. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Standardized disease information has been difficult to collect due to the rarity and diversity of VHL patients. Over 4100 unique articles published until October 2019 were screened for germline genotype-phenotype data. Patient data were translated into standardized descriptions using Human Genome Variation Society gene variant nomenclature and Human Phenotype Ontology terms and has been manually curated into an open-access knowledgebase called Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. In total, 634 unique VHL variants, 2882 patients, and 1991 families from 427 papers were captured. We identified relationship trends between phenotype and genotype data using classic statistical methods and spectral clustering unsupervised learning. Our analyses reveal earlier onset of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and retinal angiomas, phenotype co-occurrences and genotype-phenotype correlations including hotspots. It confirms existing VHL associations and can be used to identify new patterns and associations in VHL disease. Our database serves as an aggregate knowledge translation tool to facilitate sharing information about the pathogenicity of VHL variants."
    - paragraph: "Standardized evidence-based approach for assessment of oncogenic and clinical significance of NTRK fusions, March 2022, Gene fusions involving the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, are well established oncogenic drivers in a broad range of pediatric and adult tumors. These fusions are also important actionable markers, predicting often dramatic response to FDA approved kinase inhibitors. Accurate interpretation of the clinical significance of NTRK fusions is a high priority for diagnostic laboratories, but remains challenging and time consuming given the rapid pace of new data accumulation, the diversity of fusion partners and tumor types, and heterogeneous and incomplete information in variant databases and knowledgebases. The ClinGen NTRK Fusions Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panel (SC-VCEP) was formed to systematically address these challenges and create an expert-curated resource to support clinicians, researchers, patients and their families in making accurate interpretations and informed treatment decisions for NTRK fusion-driven tumors. We describe a system for NTRK fusion interpretation (including compilation of key elements and annotations) developed by the NTRK fusions SC-VCEP. We illustrate this stepwise process on examples of LMNA::NTRK1 and KANK1::NTRK2 fusions. Finally, we provide detailed analysis of current representation of NTRK fusions in public fusion databases and the CIViC knowledgebase, performed by the NTRK fusions SC-VCEP to determine existing gaps and prioritize future curation activities."
    - paragraph: "CIViCdb 2022: evolution of an open-access cancer variant interpretation knowledgebase, November 2022, CIViC (Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer; civicdb.org) is a crowd-sourced, public domain knowledgebase composed of literature-derived evidence characterizing the clinical utility of cancer variants. As clinical sequencing becomes more prevalent in cancer management, the need for cancer variant interpretation has grown beyond the capability of any single institution. CIViC contains peer-reviewed, published literature curated and expertly-moderated into structured data units (Evidence Items) that can be accessed globally and in real time, reducing barriers to clinical variant knowledge sharing. We have extended CIViC's functionality to support emergent variant interpretation guidelines, increase interoperability with other variant resources, and promote widespread dissemination of structured curated data. To support the full breadth of variant interpretation from basic to translational, including integration of somatic and germline variant knowledge and inference of drug response, we have enabled curation of three new Evidence Types (Predisposing, Oncogenic and Functional). The growing CIViC knowledgebase has over 300 contributors and distributes clinically-relevant cancer variant data currently representing >3200 variants in >470 genes from >3100 publications."
    - paragraph: "Radio-pathomic approaches in pediatric neuro-oncology: Opportunities and challenges, September 2023, With medical software platforms moving to cloud environments with scalable storage and computing, the translation of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models to aid in clinical decision-making and facilitate personalized medicine for cancer patients is becoming a reality. Medical imaging, namely radiologic and histologic images, has immense analytical potential in neuro-oncology, and models utilizing integrated radiomic and pathomic data may yield a synergistic effect and provide a new modality for precision medicine. At the same time, the ability to harness multi-modal data is met with challenges in aggregating data across medical departments and institutions, as well as significant complexity in modeling the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of pediatric brain tumors. In this paper, we review recent pathomic and integrated pathomic, radiomic, and genomic studies with clinical applications. We discuss current challenges limiting translational research on pediatric brain tumors and outline technical and analytical solutions. Overall, we propose that to empower the potential residing in radio-pathomics, systemic changes in cross-discipline data management and end-to-end software platforms to handle multi-modal data sets are needed, in addition to embracing modern AI-powered approaches. These changes can improve the performance of predictive models, and ultimately the ability to advance brain cancer treatments and patient outcomes through the development of such models."
    - paragraph: "A multi-institutional pediatric dataset of clinical radiology MRIs by the Children’s Brain Tumor Network, October 2023, Pediatric brain and spinal cancers remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Advancements in clinical decision-support in pediatric neuro-oncology utilizing the wealth of radiology imaging data collected through standard care, however, has significantly lagged other domains. Such data is ripe for use with predictive analytics such as artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which require large datasets. To address this unmet need, we provide a multi-institutional, large-scale pediatric dataset of 23,101 multi-parametric MRI exams acquired through routine care for 1,526 brain tumor patients, as part of the Children's Brain Tumor Network. This includes longitudinal MRIs across various cancer diagnoses, with associated patient-level clinical information, digital pathology slides, as well as tissue genotype and omics data. To facilitate downstream analysis, treatment-naïve images for 370 subjects were processed and released through the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative via the Cancer Data Service. Through ongoing efforts to continuously build these imaging repositories, our aim is to accelerate discovery and translational AI models with real-world data, to ultimately empower precision medicine for children."
    - paragraph: "Radiomics for characterization of the glioma immune microenvironment, June 2023, Increasing evidence suggests that besides mutational and molecular alterations, the immune component of the tumor microenvironment also substantially impacts tumor behavior and complicates treatment response, particularly to immunotherapies. Although the standard method for characterizing tumor immune profile is through performing integrated genomic analysis on tissue biopsies, the dynamic change in the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment makes this approach not feasible, especially for brain tumors. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that uses advanced imaging techniques and computational algorithms to extract numerous quantitative features from medical images. Recent advances in machine learning methods are facilitating biological validation of radiomic signatures and allowing them to 'mine' for a variety of significant correlates, including genetic, immunologic, and histologic data. Radiomics has the potential to be used as a non-invasive approach to predict the presence and density of immune cells within the microenvironment, as well as to assess the expression of immune-related genes and pathways. This information can be essential for patient stratification, informing treatment decisions and predicting patients' response to immunotherapies. This is particularly important for tumors with difficult surgical access such as gliomas. In this review, we provide an overview of the glioma microenvironment, describe novel approaches for clustering patients based on their tumor immune profile, and discuss the latest progress on utilization of radiomics for immune profiling of glioma based on current literature."
    - paragraph: "The children’s brain tumor network (CBTN) - Accelerating research in pediatric central nervous system tumors through collaboration and open science, June 2023, Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children in the United States and contribute a disproportionate number of potential years of life lost compared to adult cancers. Moreover, survivors frequently suffer long-term side effects, including secondary cancers. The Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) is a multi-institutional international clinical research consortium created to advance therapeutic development through the collection and rapid distribution of biospecimens and data via open-science research platforms for real-time access and use by the global research community. The CBTN's 32 member institutions utilize a shared regulatory governance architecture at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to accelerate and maximize the use of biospecimens and data. As of August 2022, CBTN has enrolled over 4700 subjects, over 1500 parents, and collected over 65,000 biospecimen aliquots for research. Additionally, over 80 preclinical models have been developed from collected tumors. Multi-omic data for over 1000 tumors and germline material are currently available with data generation for > 5000 samples underway. To our knowledge, CBTN provides the largest open-access pediatric brain tumor multi-omic dataset annotated with longitudinal clinical and outcome data, imaging, associated biospecimens, child-parent genomic pedigrees, and in vivo and in vitro preclinical models. Empowered by NIH-supported platforms such as the Kids First Data Resource and the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, the CBTN continues to expand the resources needed for scientists to accelerate translational impact for improved outcomes and quality of life for children with brain and spinal cord tumors."
    - paragraph: "Cancer Informatics for Cancer Centers: Scientific Drivers for Informatics, Data Science, and Care in Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer, August 2021, Cancer Informatics for Cancer Centers (CI4CC) is a grassroots, nonprofit 501c3 organization intended to provide a focused national forum for engagement of senior cancer informatics leaders, primarily aimed at academic cancer centers anywhere in the world but with a special emphasis on the 70 National Cancer Institute–funded cancer centers. This consortium has regularly held topic-focused biannual face-to-face symposiums. These meetings are a place to review cancer informatics and data science priorities and initiatives, providing a forum for discussion of the strategic and pragmatic issues that we faced at our respective institutions and cancer centers. Here, we provide meeting highlights from the latest CI4CC Symposium, which was delayed from its original April 2020 schedule because of the COVID-19 pandemic and held virtually over three days (September 24, October 1, and October 8) in the fall of 2020. In addition to the content presented, we found that holding this event virtually once a week for 6 hours was a great way to keep the kind of deep engagement that a face-to-face meeting engenders. This is the second such publication of CI4CC Symposium highlights, the first covering the meeting that took place in Napa, California, from October 14-16, 2019. We conclude with some thoughts about using data science to learn from every child with cancer, focusing on emerging activities of the National Cancer Institute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative."
    - paragraph: "Children’s Oncology Group’s 2023 blueprint for research: Epidemiology, July 2023, The Children's Oncology Group (COG) Epidemiology Committee has a primary focus on better understanding the etiologies of childhood cancers. Over the past 10 years, the committee has leveraged the Childhood Cancer Research Network, and now more recently Project:EveryChild (PEC), to conduct epidemiologic assessments of various childhood cancers, including osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumors, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. More recent studies have utilized questionnaire data collected as part of PEC to focus on specific characteristics and/or features, including the presence of congenital disorders and the availability of stored cord blood. Members of the COG Epidemiology Committee have also been involved in other large-scale National Institutes of Health efforts, including the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative and the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, which are improving our understanding of the factors associated with childhood cancer risk. Future plans will focus on addressing questions surrounding health disparities, utilizing novel biospecimens in COG epidemiology studies, exploring the role of environmental factors on the etiologies and outcomes of childhood cancer, collaborating with other COG committees to expand the role of epidemiology in childhood cancer research, and building new epidemiologic studies from the Molecular Characterization Initiative—all with the ultimate goal of developing novel prevention and intervention strategies for childhood cancer."
    - paragraph: "IMMUNOTAR - Integrative prioritization of cell surface targets for cancer immunotherapy, June 2024, Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality globally. Recent improvements in survival have been facilitated by the development of less toxic immunotherapies; however, identifying targets for immunotherapies remains a challenge in the field. To address this challenge, we developed IMMUNOTAR, a computational tool that systematically prioritizes and identifies candidate immunotherapeutic targets. IMMUNOTAR integrates user-provided RNA-sequencing or proteomics data with quantitative features extracted from publicly available databases based on predefined optimal immunotherapeutic target criteria and quantitatively prioritizes potential surface protein targets. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of IMMUNOTAR using three distinct datasets, validating its effectiveness in identifying both known and new potential immunotherapeutic targets within the analyzed cancer phenotypes. Overall, IMMUNOTAR enables the compilation of data from multiple sources into a unified platform, allowing users to simultaneously evaluate surface proteins across diverse criteria. By streamlining target identification, IMMUNOTAR empowers researchers to efficiently allocate resources and accelerate immunotherapy development."
    - paragraph: "St. Jude Cloud’s Disease Ontology, May 2024, Ontologies designed for disease classification have redefined our understanding of diseases by providing a hierarchical structure of complex biomedical data. In cancer research, they are critical for data sharing, integration, and collaboration among researchers. However, existing ontologies on pediatric cancer classification are limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) and OncoTree primarily focus on adult cancers while leaving gaps in many pediatric cancer subtypes driven by molecular etiology presented in recent scientific literature. To enable data sharing and integration of the whole-genome, whole-exome and RNA-seq data generated from 13,956 cases of pediatric cancer and long-term survivors on St. Jude Cloud, we recognized the significance of such gaps and initiated the development of a tailored disease ontology to address this issue."
    - paragraph: "Making the case for an International Childhood Cancer Data Partnership, January 2025, hildhood cancers are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases, accounting for less than 2% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide. Most countries, therefore, do not have enough cases to provide robust information on epidemiology, treatment, and late effects, especially for rarer types of cancer. Thus, only through a concerted effort to share data internationally will we be able to answer research questions that could not otherwise be answered. With this goal in mind, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the French National Cancer Institute co-sponsored the Paris Conference for an International Childhood Cancer Data Partnership in November 2023. This meeting convened more than 200 participants from 17 countries to address complex challenges in pediatric cancer research and data sharing. This Commentary delves into some key topics discussed during the Paris Conference and describes pilots that will help move this international effort forward. Main topics presented include: 1) the wide variation in interpreting the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation among Member States; 2) obstacles with transferring personal health data outside of the European Union; 3) standardization and harmonization, including common data models; and 4) novel approaches to data sharing such as federated querying and federated learning. We finally provide a brief description of three ongoing pilot projects. The International Childhood Cancer Data Partnership is the first step in developing a process to better support pediatric cancer research internationally through combining data from multiple countries."
    - paragraph: "Multicenter Histology Image Integration and Multiscale Deep Learning for Pediatric Sarcoma Subtype Classification, September 2024, Pediatric sarcomas are rare and diverse, with few highly specialized centers reviewing sufficient volume to hone histopathological expertise, resulting in frequent misclassification. Digitization of histology slides enables automated imaging analysis and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sarcoma subtype classification. Such tools are reproducible, mitigate against inter-observer bias, and can be implemented at a distance, allowing for global access to more precise diagnostics. A limitation is insufficient high-quality data to train models and avoid overfitting. Here, we amass a digitized sarcoma histology dataset from multiple centers. We designed a computational pipeline to (1) harmonize images to remove center-specific artifacts, (2) mirror a traditional pathologist’s process by extracting imaging features at varying sizes and magnifications, and (3) implement the latest in deep learning backbones to perform automated classification of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) v. non-rhabdomyosarcoma (NRSTS) and further subtyping. We provide powerful proof of concept for the ability of these techniques to expand access to highly specialized care to the global pediatric sarcoma population. Methods: Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained images and limited clinical data were collected with representation from numerous centers. We optimized a pipeline for focus checking, resolution standardization, stain normalization, and image format conversion to generate a harmonized dataset of over 500 images. We tested varying tile sizes and overlaps, magnification powers, and single- vs. multi-scale concatenated-feature sets to optimize classification accuracy. Deep learning feature extraction was performed with two backbones (InceptionV3 and CTranspath). Using our previously developed SAMPLER method, we create statistical representations of each feature to train and test ANN classifiers for RMS vs NRSTS and further subtype predictions. Results: Optimal parameters were 224 pixel tile size and 112 micron spacing on center, yielding non-overlapping tiles when viewed at 20X, 0.5 microns per pixel (mpp). Single scale feature extraction at 0.5 and 1.0 outperformed 0.75 mpp. Multi-scale feature concatenation from the combination of 0.5 and 1.0 mpp provided the best overall classification performance. In matched analyses of all tested parameter combinations, CTranspath outperformed InceptionV3 with consistently higher area under curve. Conclusions: Our multi-institutional pediatric sarcoma histology dataset represents the broadest harmonized resource of this type to our knowledge. Using a multiscale approach and optimized tiling parameters, we demonstrate the superiority of vision transformer- over strict convolutional ANNs to provide gross distinction between sarcoma subtypes. Our harmonization procedures open the door for expansion of the dataset through ongoing multi-institutional collaboration, bringing promise for a future in which automated image review may accurately and remotely identify sarcoma histology, improving subtype-specific delivery of care."

This new tool allows users to explore CCDI supported data in new ways and make connections with participants, samples, and files available through the NCI’s Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC). The initial release of the CCDI Hub Explore Dashboard includes 8 CCDI supported studies and information on over 4,100 participants, 10,350 samples, and 132,000 files. The following Studies are included in this release: Genomic Characterization: Juvenile Myelo Monocytic Leukemia (PHS002504) Molecular Characterization: Pediatric Brain Tumors & other Cancers (PHS002517) OncoKids Cancer Panel: Pediatric Cancers (PHS002518) Comprehensive Genomic Sequencing: Pediatric Cancers (PHS002529) Genomic Landscape: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (PHS002599) Whole Genome & Transcriptome Profiling: Pediatric and Young Adult Cancers (PHS002620) CCDI‘s Molecular Characterization Initiative (PHS002790) Molecular Characterization during Clonal Evolution: High-risk Neuroblastoma (PHS003111) The new Explore Dashboard allows for single-study and cross-study discovery, building information cohorts on filtered metrics of interest. A participant-centric faceted search tool allows users to filter the available information based on six categories – Demographics, Diagnosis, Samples, Data Category, Study, and Library. Each category includes unique data elements that allow for targeted filtering. For both filtered and non-filtered data, the Explore Dashboard shares data in charts and on a data table. The Explore Dashboard includes visualizations for six different data elements - Study, Diagnosis (ICD-O), Age at Diagnosis (years), Race, Gender, and Ethnicity. Each visualization adjusts as filter selections are made. The data table displays information on five unique tabs - Participants, Diagnosis, Studies, Samples, and Files. Each tab includes different data elements and adjusts as filter selections are made. The data table allows users to export the cohort results in two different ways for further exploration and analysis. Each tab of the data table includes an ‘Export’ button that will download a CSV that includes the filtered or non-filtered information shown on the tab. Additionally, each row of the data table is selectable, and each selection can be used to populate the File-Centric Cart. Selections can be made at the study level, the participant level, the sample level, or at the individual level. Once populated, the file-centric cart can be used to create a CSV manifest file of the curated files found using the tool Explore Dashboard. This curated manifest can then be used within CGC to facilitate easier selection of CCDI files with the Cancer Data Service Explorer.

  title: "MCI"
  content:
    - paragraph: "The CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI) provides state-of-the-art molecular testing at no cost to newly diagnosed children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, soft tissue sarcomas (STS), certain rare (RAR) childhood cancers, and certain neuroblastomas (NBL) being treated at a Children’s Oncology Group (COG)–affiliated hospital. The goal of this initiative is to enhance the understanding of the genetic factors involved in pediatric cancers and to provide timely, clinically relevant findings to doctors and families. This project uses Project:EveryChild (APEC14B1) to enroll participants, collect specimens, and annotate clinical data. The results of genetic testing will be shared with the treating physician and participants or their family, aiding in treatment decisions. This will also determine eligibility for certain planned COG clinical trials."
    - paragraph: "For an overview of this initiative, access the MCI web page on cancer.gov."
    - paragraph: "Enrollment and Participation"
    - paragraph: "APEC14B1-MCI ENROLLMENT METRICS"
    - paragraph: "The MCI enrollment metrics are based on counts of patients enrolled with MCI through Project:EveryChild (APEC14B1) and are based on monthly COG reporting."
    - paragraph: "MCI PARTICIPATION"
    - paragraph: "Patients are required to enroll in APEC14B1 before participating in MCI, and those eligible to participate need to enroll in MCI and consent to molecular characterization. Currently, only patients with newly diagnosed CNS, STS, RAR, and NBL tumors will be eligible to participate. Patients enrolling in APEC14B1 with secondary or second malignancy are not eligible to participate in MCI."
    - paragraph: "Testing and Results"
    - paragraph: "TESTING TYPES"
    - paragraph: "What types of testing will be conducted on the specimens submitted for MCI?"
    - paragraph: "The Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, OH, will conduct: Enhanced paired tumor–normal exome sequencing (ES), *A targeted RNA Solid Tumor Fusion assay, A DNA-based methylation array assay for CNS tumor classification, Clinical Molecular Characterization Initiative Assays and Analytics"
    - paragraph: "Abbreviations: ES, exome sequencing; AWS, Amazon Web Services; SNV, single-nucleotide variant; INDEL, insertion/deletion; CNV, copy number variation; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; ITD, internal tandem duplication [PMID: 29539639]."
    - paragraph: "*The RNA Solid Tumor Fusion assay is not performed on NBL tumors."
    - paragraph: "MCI RESULTS REPORTING"
    - paragraph: "When and how are MCI results provided?"
    - paragraph: "Results from molecular testing are returned within 21 days of receipt of all required materials at the COG Biobank hosted by the Biopathology Center (BPC) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Once nucleic acid has been received within IGM from the BPC, results will be issued into the portal within 14 days. As each test is resulted, an email will be sent to the clinician and clinical research associate contacts listed on a contact form filled out by the participant’s care team. The email will include a link to the secure web portal where results can be accessed. Participants will receive results from their treating physician."
    - paragraph: "What type of results will be reported for exome sequencing (ES)?"
    - paragraph: "Somatic disease–germline comparator sequencing is a paired tumor–normal exome analysis which incorporates an exome reagent assaying the coding regions of more than 19,000 protein-coding genes. In the setting of both germline and somatic analysis, only cancer-related genomic variation is reported."
    - paragraph: "For germline analysis, the report is focused on pathogenic or likely pathogenic variation in cancer-associated genes; however, variants of uncertain significance in genes with clear association to the cancer type under study may be reported. Germline variants are classified using the ACMG/AMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Secondary or incidental findings are not reported. For somatic analysis, the report is focused on Tier I and Tier II variants (strong or potential significance, respectively) as classified according to the AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines (PMID: 27993330). Cancer-associated copy number variation from either germline or somatic analysis is classified in accordance with ACMG/CGC guidelines with reporting of Tier 1 and Tier 2 variants (strong or some known clinical significance, respectively; PMID: 31138931)."
    - paragraph: "Due to the nature of exome sequencing, full gene coverage is not guaranteed. This assay does not detect exon-level deletions or duplications and may not be capable of detecting gene-level copy number variation below 105kb resolution. This testing is not intended for carrier screening. The report incorporates information curated from the medical literature, genetic databases, and variant knowledgebases, which are subject to change over time due to new scientific discoveries. The report must be considered within the clinical context of the patient, in conjunction with other relevant findings and clinical history."
    - paragraph: "Here is a list of genes that are reviewed for germline and somatic variation in the setting of this analysis (as of August 30, 2024). These cancer-associated genes have been curated from medical and scientific literature, databases, and professional guidelines."
    - paragraph: "What genes are included in the targeted RNA Solid Fusion assay?"
    - paragraph: "The gene targets below are included in the Solid Tumor fusion assay (v2), which utilizes anchored multiplex PCR (ArcherDx) followed by next-generation sequencing to identify gene fusions or intragenic structural rearrangements, such as internal tandem duplications. Based on the methodology, if one fusion partner is encompassed in the assay, there is a high sensitivity to detect the other partner. For example, the assay targets critical regions within BRAF known to be involved in gene fusion events, which would allow this test to detect a fusion with a common partner such as KIAA1549. This assay would also enable detection of more rare or novel gene partners associated with a BRAF fusion if the tumor harbored such an event. Here are the gene targets included in this assay."
    - paragraph: "Will DNA methylation results be returned for all patients?"
    - paragraph: "Accessing MCI Data and Tools"
    - paragraph: "HOW TO ACCESS MCI DATA"

    - paragraph: "The participant’s physician should coordinate a referral for the participant and their family to do local genetic counseling. In this setting, familial cascade testing for the observed germline variant may be offered to the family where appropriate. Such testing typically takes the form of targeted Sanger or microarray analysis, performed in concert with pre and post-test genetic counseling on the significance of the genetic variant. Familial testing may be performed by the institutional molecular laboratory (if those services are available locally) or through typical send-out testing channels familiar to the clinician and counselor."

  title: "CCDI Data Federation Resource"
  content:
    - paragraph: "Data federation enables users to pull data from across various resources as if they were accessing a single virtual database, rather than consolidating all data into a single centralized repository. The data remain at the original source but become searchable and findable to the research community through a standard application programming interface (API). This allows the creation of a virtual cohort and facilitates large-scale analytic research by making deidentified participant-level data (non-PHI/PII) findable across the sources."
    - paragraph: "The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is piloting data federation with Kids First Data Resource Center, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons, St. Jude Cloud, and the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. These resources provide information about genomic, clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data in these data sets. This list will expand as more organizations implement CCDI’s data federation API."
    - paragraph: "Data Access"
    - paragraph: "Researchers can search for deidentified individual-level data through the API, which provides metadata that aids in the creation of virtual cohorts across multiple data types from participating resources by accessing CCDI’s Data Federation Resource API."
    - paragraph: "To access the CCDI Data Federation Resource API, please click here."
    - paragraph: "To access participating nodes API, please click here."
    - paragraph: "The API does not deliver files. Rather, it provides an open-access subset of the metadata (e.g., demographics) that match a user’s search criteria and provides the location of the complete data set. The data are accessible according to the policies at each contributing resource."
    - paragraph: "Additional Available Resources"

  title: "CCDI Participant Index"
  content:
      - paragraph: " The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Participant Index (CPI) maps research participant identifiers across multiple studies and institutions, collectively referred to as “Domains”. By mappings these identifiers, CPI enables researchers to connect data associated with the same individual across different datasets stored in sources such as the CCDI Hub and National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR). This mapping capability enhances the discovery of multimodal data, facilitating the exploration of complex research questions, and ultimately supporting the development of innovative therapies for pediatric cancers."
      - paragraph: "Components"
      - paragraph: "“Identifiers” and “Domains” make up the structure of the CPI. These elements are essential for organizing and mapping participant data across various studies and organizations. The key components include:"
      - paragraph: "Identifier: A public identifier (Participant ID) appearing in a research dataset accessible to researchers (e.g., Kids First ID, GENIE ID)."
      - paragraph: "Domain: Groups of unique participant IDs categorized as follows:"
      - paragraph: "Organizational Identifier: A project/network of unique participant identifiers (e.g. Children's Oncology Group,   AACR GENIE, Pediatric Cancer Data Commons)."
      - paragraph: "Data Set: A single dataset for a particular study where data files for the participants can be found (e.g., dbGaP accession numbers)."
      - paragraph: "Study: Programmatic references to research initiatives (e.g., TARGET, Gabriella Miller Kids First)."
      - paragraph: "Further information on CPI components and functions can be found at participantindex-docs.ccdi.cancer.gov."
      - paragraph: "Core Functions of the CPI"
      - paragraph: "The CPI API functions as a reference service that allows software applications to communicate with each other, providing information on participants’ research IDs to authorized applications. Integration with the CPI is currently under development for applications like the CCDI Hub and Federation Data Resource."
      - paragraph: "The CPI addresses key questions such as:"
      - paragraph: "Which participants and domains are associated with mine? Authorized applications can input participant ID(s) and retrieve all associated IDs along with their respective domains... This helps in mapping participants across different data sets and studies."
      - paragraph: "What are the current domains in the CPI and their participant statistics? Authorized users can access comprehensive information about each domain within the CPI database. This includes the domain name, description, category, and a URL linking to additional data, offering context about where a participant’s data is present. Also available are participant statistics for each domain, including the number of participants mapped to various domains, along with the total counts of participants."
      - paragraph: "Request Access"
