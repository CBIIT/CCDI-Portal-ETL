    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative Hub: The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Hub is an entry point for researchers, data scientists, and citizen scientists looking to use and connect with CCDI-related data. It provides information about available tools and applications that support the CCDI vision, along with descriptions of resources, each of which targets specific aspects of childhood cancer research. The Hub also provides direct links to resources and additional technical information. Users are invited to explore the Hub or select a resource’s link to learn more."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative: The NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. By connecting, analyzing, and easily sharing data among researchers, we can increase our understanding of childhood cancers and improve treatment, quality of life, and survivorship for all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer."

    - paragraph: "August Childhood Cancer Data Catalog release goes live, AUGUST 17, 2023, Users of the Childhood Cancer Data Catalog can now filter by the resource type, “Biorepository.” As part of this resource type, four new resources have been added, including Norwegian Childhood Cancer Biobank, Swedish Childhood Tumor Biobank, The Biopathology Center, and VIVO Biobank. There are also ten additional data sets available and several updates to existing resources."
    - paragraph: "Molecular Targets Platform (MTP) release allows interactive data visualizations, JULY 21, 2023, The Molecular Targets Platform (MTP) is now live with interactive visualizations of data via the Pediatric Data Navigation page. There is also improved plot generation for the OpenPedCan Gene Expression and Differential Expression widgets, along with updated descriptions in the “Pediatric Cancer Data Visualizations” section on the About page regarding the chart types added in the previous MTP release."
    - paragraph: "Molecular Characterization and Clinical Data from Multiple Organizations Released, JULY 20, 2023, CCDI has facilitated the release of data from children and young adults diagnosed with pediatric brain tumors and other solid and hematologic malignancies. The data was collected from the Children’s Brain Tumor Network, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Division for Genomic Diagnostics. They include tumor and germline WGS, RNA-Seq, Clinical Panel Sequencing, and other omics and molecular data. Access these data through dbGaP."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Catalog (CCDC) updates include a guide for accessing CCDI data, JULY 19, 2023, The Childhood Cancer Data Catalog now has three new resources. One is the Childhood Cancer Registry, which banks and distributes cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. The other two are analytical tools—The Cancer Research Institute iAtlas, which includes tools for studying tumor and immune microenvironment interactions, and The Cancer Proteome Atlas, through which users can access proteomics data. Importantly, there's also a new guide on how to access, query, and process CCDI data stored at NCI’s Cancer Data Service."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Catalog updates with new resources and datasets, JUNE 14, 2023, The Cancermodels.org resource has been added to the CCDI Childhood Cancer Data Catalog. This is a free, open-source platform that collects clinical, genomic, and functional data from patient-derived xenografts, organoids, and cell lines. The catalog update also includes 13 new datasets, eight of which are from the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Portal (ScPCA)."
    - paragraph: "Molecular Targets Platform releases data updates and enhanced features, JUNE 2, 2023, The Molecular Targets Platform (MTP) expanded with new data and enhanced features. Researchers will find new and updated data from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas and TARGET cohorts, including sequencing and methylation data. Improved features include enhanced gene expression graphs for childhood cancer data and a new widget to capture methylation data. Finally, the latest coding updates ensure that the data can be easily viewed and queried. Learn more about how the MTP is helping advance childhood cancer research."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Catalog update includes new resource, MAY 17, 2023, The CCDI Childhood Cancer Data Catalog (CCDC) now includes the Cancer Dependency Map, which provides open access to analytical and visualization tools related to key cancer dependencies.
