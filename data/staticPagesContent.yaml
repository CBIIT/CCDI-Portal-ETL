    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative Hub: The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Hub is an entry point for researchers, data scientists, and citizen scientists looking to use and connect with CCDI-related data. It provides information about available tools and applications that support the CCDI vision, along with descriptions of resources, each of which targets specific aspects of childhood cancer research. The Hub also provides direct links to resources and additional technical information. Users are invited to explore the Hub or select a resource’s link to learn more."
    - paragraph: "Childhood Cancer Data Initiative: The NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. By connecting, analyzing, and easily sharing data among researchers, we can increase our understanding of childhood cancers and improve treatment, quality of life, and survivorship for all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer."

    - paragraph: "Molecular characterization results returned to more than 1,000 participants: Application Update, 4/5/23, In March, enrollment in the CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative reached 1,000 children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) participants newly diagnosed with certain types of cancer. In March, enrollment in the CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI) reached 1,000 participants. This milestone means that more than 1,000 children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) newly diagnosed with certain types of cancer have a more precise diagnosis with which providers can plan their treatment. Enrollment continues, free of charge, for children and AYAs newly diagnosed with central nervous system tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and rare tumors who are receiving care from a Children’s Oncology Group–affiliated hospital. MCI data—excluding personal details that identify participants—will continue to be released monthly, giving researchers an opportunity to learn more about what drives various cancers, develop better clinical trials, and develop more effective treatments for childhood cancer."

More than 800 researchers, clinicians, survivors, and families from the community gathered to discuss how enhanced data connection and sharing can address current issues and possibilities in childhood cancer research. On March 24, 2023, NCI hosted the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative Annual Symposium. Researchers, clinicians, survivors, and families from the community gathered to discuss how enhanced data connection and sharing can address current issues and possibilities in childhood cancer research. Dialogue between speakers and attendees, both virtual and in-person, celebrated CCDI's accomplishments to date and identified challenges and priorities that lie ahead.  Highlights included discussion of linking patients to disparate data sets, using tumor genomic data to create precision oncology clinical trials, extracting data from electronic health records, and other topics important for the pediatrics cancer community.

    - paragraph: "National Cancer Plan, News & Other, 4/3/23, On April 3, National Cancer Institute released the National Cancer Plan to engage the broadest possible community to work together to end cancer as we know it. National Cancer Institute (NCI) has released a National Cancer Plan, a long-term, ambitious framework to end cancer as we know it. The Plan represents a coordinated national response to achieve the goals of the Cancer Moonshot and deliver better cancer outcomes to all people. The development of the National Cancer Plan was made in part due to the contributions of a broad coalition of partners, including the National Cancer Advisory Board, NCI’s Council of Research Advocates and numerous stakeholders across NIH, HHS, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Office of the First Lady. The plan offers something for everyone who wants to join in creating a society where more cancers are prevented and every person with cancer lives a full and active life. At its core, the National Cancer Plan features eight goals that build on our current knowledge and describe an ideal future state—essential components to ending cancer as we know it. Prevent Cancer, Detect Cancers Early, Develop Effective Treatments, Eliminate Inequities, Deliver Optimal Care, Engage Every Person, Maximize Data Utility, Optimize the Workforce, Everything at NCI helps to drive progress toward these goals. The National Cancer Plan helps to describe ongoing and emerging initiatives and invites others to do the same.  The better NCI and its partners can identify gaps in cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and care, the better all communities are able to work across society to address them.  "
