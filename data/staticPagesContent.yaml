The goal of this initiative is to enhance the understanding of the genetic factors involved in pediatric cancers and to provide timely, clinically relevant findings to doctors and families. This project uses Project:EveryChild (APEC14B1) to enroll participants, collect specimens, and annotate clinical data. The results of genetic testing will be shared with the treating physician and participants or their family, aiding in treatment decisions. This will also determine eligibility for certain planned COG clinical trials."
    - paragraph: "For an overview of this initiative, access the MCI web page on cancer.gov."
    - paragraph: "Enrollment and Participation"
    - paragraph: "APEC14B1-MCI ENROLLMENT METRICS"

    - paragraph: "Testing and Results"
    - paragraph: "TESTING TYPES"
    - paragraph: "What types of testing will be conducted on the specimens submitted for MCI?"
    - paragraph: "The Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, OH, will conduct: Enhanced paired tumor–normal exome sequencing (ES), *A targeted RNA Solid Tumor Fusion assay, A DNA-based methylation array assay for CNS tumor classification, Clinical Molecular Characterization Initiative Assays and Analytics"
    - paragraph: "Abbreviations: ES, exome sequencing; AWS, Amazon Web Services; SNV, single-nucleotide variant; INDEL, insertion/deletion; CNV, copy number variation; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; ITD, internal tandem duplication [PMID: 29539639]."
    - paragraph: "*The RNA Solid Tumor Fusion assay is not performed on NBL tumors."
    - paragraph: "MCI RESULTS REPORTING"
    - paragraph: "When and how are MCI results provided?"
    - paragraph: "Results from molecular testing are returned within 21 days of receipt of all required materials at the COG Biobank hosted by the Biopathology Center (BPC) at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Once nucleic acid has been received within IGM from the BPC, results will be issued into the portal within 14 days. As each test is resulted, an email will be sent to the clinician and clinical research associate contacts listed on a contact form filled out by the participant’s care team. The email will include a link to the secure web portal where results can be accessed. Participants will receive results from their treating physician."
    - paragraph: "What type of results will be reported for exome sequencing (ES)?"
    - paragraph: "Somatic disease–germline comparator sequencing is a paired tumor–normal exome analysis which incorporates an exome reagent assaying the coding regions of more than 19,000 protein-coding genes. In the setting of both germline and somatic analysis, only cancer-related genomic variation is reported."
    - paragraph: "For germline analysis, the report is focused on pathogenic or likely pathogenic variation in cancer-associated genes; however, variants of uncertain significance in genes with clear association to the cancer type under study may be reported. Germline variants are classified using the ACMG/AMP guidelines (PMID: 25741868). Secondary or incidental findings are not reported. For somatic analysis, the report is focused on Tier I and Tier II variants (strong or potential significance, respectively) as classified according to the AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines (PMID: 27993330). Cancer-associated copy number variation from either germline or somatic analysis is classified in accordance with ACMG/CGC guidelines with reporting of Tier 1 and Tier 2 variants (strong or some known clinical significance, respectively; PMID: 31138931)."
    - paragraph: "Due to the nature of exome sequencing, full gene coverage is not guaranteed. This assay does not detect exon-level deletions or duplications and may not be capable of detecting gene-level copy number variation below 105kb resolution. This testing is not intended for carrier screening. The report incorporates information curated from the medical literature, genetic databases, and variant knowledgebases, which are subject to change over time due to new scientific discoveries. The report must be considered within the clinical context of the patient, in conjunction with other relevant findings and clinical history."
    - paragraph: "Here is a list of genes that are reviewed for germline and somatic variation in the setting of this analysis as of July 10, 2024. These cancer-associated genes have been curated from medical and scientific literature, databases, and professional guidelines."
    - paragraph: "What genes are included in the targeted RNA Solid Fusion assay?"
    - paragraph: "The gene targets below are included in the Solid Tumor fusion assay (v2), which utilizes anchored multiplex PCR (ArcherDx) followed by next-generation sequencing to identify gene fusions or intragenic structural rearrangements, such as internal tandem duplications. Based on the methodology, if one fusion partner is encompassed in the assay, there is a high sensitivity to detect the other partner. For example, the assay targets critical regions within BRAF known to be involved in gene fusion events, which would allow this test to detect a fusion with a common partner such as KIAA1549. This assay would also enable detection of more rare or novel gene partners associated with a BRAF fusion if the tumor harbored such an event. Here are the gene targets included in this assay."
    - paragraph: "Will DNA methylation results be returned for all patients?"
    - paragraph: "Accessing MCI Data"
