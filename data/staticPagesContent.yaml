    - paragraph: "Funding Methods: This initial phase of the INS only gathers outputs from extramural grants . Other funding sources such as intramural grants and contracts will be addressed in the future."
    - paragraph: "Initial Program Scope: This initial phase of the INS only gathers outputs from grants funded under two programs: the Cancer MoonshotSM and the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI). Though grouping projects under “programs” is useful for organizational purposes, the program-grant link is not always clearly defined or publicly available. A list of projects associated with the Cancer Moonshot was obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System , while a list of projects associated with CCDI was provided by the NCI’s Office of Data Sharing. These lists were used as input into our automated data gathering process outlined below."

    - paragraph: "Data Organization: The Moonshot program is not currently subdivided into Moonshot initiatives within the INS. Projects are currently organized within the INS by the full grant number (e.g., “1U24CA224319-01”), which means that a single core project ID (e.g., “UC24CA224319”) may be listed several times with multiple funding years. However, because researchers usually cite core project IDs (rather than full grant numbers) in their published outputs, the INS groups data outputs by core project ID. This leads to some known false positive results where outputs associated with a core project ID are associated with a full grant number when they should not be. For instance, a full grant number for a particular year could show a false association with a publication published before the grant was awarded because of a true association between that publication and an earlier grant with the same core project ID. This discrepancy is being evaluated for improvement in a future release."
    - paragraph: "Data Sourcing: The INS relies on several public resources to connect and enrich our data, which comes with the challenge of interoperability and inherent risk of propagating source errors. Details on projects (using full grant numbers) are obtained from the NIH RePORTER resource. The information linking projects to a Division/Office/Center (DOC) are obtained from administrative databases, which may contain inconsistencies where the link between Program Officers, DOCs, and projects may change over the years. Publications, Clinical Trials, and Patents are obtained by automated searching of core project IDs against public resources: PubMed , ClinicalTrials.gov , and US Patent and Trademark Office , respectively. Publication information is further enriched with metrics obtained from NIH iCite . Dataset information is obtained by indirectly linking datasets to core project IDs through the publications citing them. The initial phase of the INS is only gathering datasets from three repositories: database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) , Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) , and Sequence Read Archive (SRA)."
